## 🧠 About The Project

Modern React Contact Management is a front-end contact manager application built with React.

This project focuses on:

- Managing form state efficiently
- Handling four controlled inputs with a single function
- Implementing form validation logic
- Preventing duplicate contacts
- Creating a clean and responsive UI

The app allows users to add contacts only when all required inputs are valid and prevents duplicate entries based on name or phone number.

## 🧠 Form Validation Logic

The form includes four input fields, all controlled by a single state handler.

### Validation Rules:

- All fields are required  
- No empty inputs allowed  
- Name must be unique  
- Phone number must be unique  
- If validation fails → error message is displayed  
- If validation passes → contact is added to the list
